# Contributing Guidelines

## Code of Conduct
Help us keep List of Demands open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Ways to Contribute

### Report bugs
- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/goinvo/ListofDemands/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a [new issue](https://github.com/goinvo/ListofDemands/issues/new) and label it 'bug'. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Fix bugs
- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
- Ensure the pull request description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
- The team will review your pull request and respond within 24 business hours.

### Suggest new features
- Suggest your change as a [new issue](https://github.com/goinvo/ListofDemands/issues/new) and label it 'feature request' before writing code.
- The team will review your new feature and respond within 24 business hours.

### Edit code or documentation
- No pull request is too small: fix typos, add code comments, clean up inconsistent whitespace.
